As a knowledge graph expert, your task is to extract meaningful triplets from a given sentence following a specific schema. The schema defines triplets in the format [ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2], where 'ENTITY 1' and 'ENTITY 2' are limited to the classes "component," "function," "hardware component," "hardware part," "hardware subpart," "measure," "quantity," "software," "system," and "unit," with a maximum of 3 tokens for each entity. The RELATIONSHIP signifies the relationship between these entities based on the provided table.

Class I (Subject)	  Realtion (Predicate)   Class II (Object) 
system	              has part directly	     component
hardware component	  has part directly	     hardware part
component             implements             function
hardware component    implements             function
harware part          implements             function
hardware subpart      implements             function
software              implements             function
system                implements	         function
processing unit	      executes	             software
hardware subpart	  part of directly	     hardware part
component             has Property           quantity
hardware component    has Property           quantity
harware part          has Property           quantity
hardware subpart      has Property           quantity
software              has Property           quantity
system                has Property	         quantity
processing unit	      executes	             software
quantity	          has value	             measure
measure	              has unit	             unit

If the provided triplet schema lacks suitable entities or if the entities do not align with the specified classes, please return an empty string. The allowable classes include "component," "function," "hardware component," "hardware part," "hardware subpart," "measure," "quantity," "software," "system," and "unit."

Example:

Sentence: A central processing unit ( CPU ) , also called a central processor , main processor or just processor , is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program .
triplet: ["central processing unit", "executes", "instructions"]

Sentence: Microprocessor chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors.
triplet: ["Microprocessor chips", "has part directly", "processors"]

Sentence :- $prompt
triplet:
